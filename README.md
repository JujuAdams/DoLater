DoLater is a small library that improves upon GameMaker's native [`call_later()`](https://manual.yoyogames.com/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Time_Sources/call_later.htm) function allowing you to specify arguments for the callback. Additionally, the returned handle from `DoLater` calls is a proper time source. Time sources generated by DoLater are automatically cleaned up when they are stopped.
